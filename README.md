# These are my configurations!

Right now this just consists of my full nvim setup. I keep it minimal. Not too much going on with the UI and a solid background to limit distractions, I get distracted very easily and my background is my picture of a red porsche so i could look at it for hours.  

Goal: look like the TVA computer terminals eventually. Get the perfect orange and font and maybe program ms.minutes to appear in my UI or at least on my "homepage" with the alpha plugin.

There is the green-shades theme in the set up, the idea for that was to look like the fallout 4 computer terminal which is mostly Green and Black so that was the inspo behind that ðŸ˜…  

That being said, as i make more configurations on my computer I will promptly add them here. Should I finish my goal I will add the updated files here, but seperate from the files as they are incase someone out there wants to just copy the base set up.
